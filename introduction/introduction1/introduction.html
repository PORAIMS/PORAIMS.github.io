                        &nbsp; &nbsp;The history of industrial automation reveals a strong link between advancements in automation methods and global economic shifts. Industrial robots, which became distinct tools in the 1960s, along with technologies like CAD and CAM, have driven transformations in manufacturing automation. These systems have paved the way for ongoing, unpredictable changes in how industries operate. In North America, the adoption of robots surged in the early 1980s before slowing briefly, yet has grown steadily since. Robotics now plays a critical role in manufacturing, largely due to declining costs and enhanced capabilities, allowing companies to cut labor expenses significantly.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp;Industrial robots have revolutionized manufacturing by performing tasks that are not only cost-effective but also safer and sometimes impossible for humans. The cost of robotic technology is dropping, while the price of human labor rises, making robots an appealing choice for industrial tasks. By 2025, robots are projected to reduce labor costs by 16% on average. Historically, robots date back to ancient Greece, but industrial robotics took off with the introduction of Unimate in 1961, the first industrial robot used on General Motors' assembly line. Since then, robots have continuously evolved, positioning automation as a cornerstone of modern industry.
